# Revision we are print the how can find the given number in even and odd number.
# n=10
# sum_even = 0
# for i in range(1,n+1):
#   if i%2 == 0:
#     sum_even +=1
# print("sum of even number is:",sum_even)






# if we want to change the even number and odd number in 500 number how check the program.

# number = 500
# odd_number = 0
# for i in range(1,number+1):
#   if i%2 != 0:
#     odd_number += 1
# print("this is the odd number",odd_number)



# How print the star in the python.
for i in range(1,6):
  print("*"*5)
